> How to spell ... ?

Kids ask "how do you spell [word]?" a hundred times a day. In the car. At the dinner table. When you're busy. It's not annoying because you don't care — it's annoying because you can't always drop everything. This app gives them the answer on their own. Tap the button, say the word, see the spelling. Done.

## 📱 Use Cases

**1. Homework time**  
Your kid is writing a sentence and gets stuck on a word. Instead of yelling from the other room, they tap the mic, say the word, and get the spelling instantly. They stay in the flow. You stay sane.

**2. Road trips**  
"How do you spell 'dinosaur'?" for the fifth time in twenty minutes. Hand them the phone. Problem solved for the rest of the drive.

**3. Bedtime reading**  
Your kid finds a new word in their book and wants to know how to spell it. No need to stop reading. Just tap, say, see.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Tap the microphone button
2. Say "how to spell [word]" (or just say the word)
3. See the spelling on screen with visual waveform feedback
4. Tap anywhere to try another word

That's it. No accounts. No settings. No distractions.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Microphone access denied"
- **Cause**: Browser blocked microphone permission
- **Fix**: Go to browser settings → Site permissions → Microphone → Allow for this site

### "No microphone found"
- **Cause**: No microphone connected or detected
- **Fix**: Connect a microphone or use a device with built-in mic

### "No speech detected"
- **Cause**: Silence or background noise during recording
- **Fix**: Speak clearly within 2-3 seconds of tapping the mic

### "Network error"
- **Cause**: No internet connection (required for speech recognition)
- **Fix**: Check your internet connection and try again

### "Audio capture failed"
- **Cause**: Another app is using the microphone
- **Fix**: Close other apps using the microphone and refresh the page
